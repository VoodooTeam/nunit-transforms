# nunit-transforms

This project is a collection of contributed XSLT transforms for use with the NUnit result file.

Each transform is found in a separate folder, which contains the transform plus other files
provided by the author, normally a README and LICENSE. The NUnit team does not maintain these
contributions. Please read the README for each one and contact the author about any problems or
other assistance needed with the particular transform.
